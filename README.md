# Database Project

## Details of database
We created a database that allows for reliable CRUD operations on fictitious data of farmers markets. The data was generated by ipynb files and formatted into csv files to be inserted into the SQL database.
An image is included below for a quick understanding of the information we are tracking. If you would like a more elaborate explanation, please view the report pdf

## Details of webapp
We made a very basic webapp using streamlit that allows for users to query the database. This is of course not a realistic product as users would not be writing the SQL statements themselves.
We just did this to verify that it would function properly, and to do some practice
