The queries and commands to create the relations of our database are inside create.sql. There is no script or commands to load our created dataset in the database. 
Again, our dataset was created, not borrowed. Although we did borrow farm names from: https://www.nichepursuits.com/farm-names/ and human names from:
https://github.com/hadley/data-baby-names/blob/master/baby-names.csv. Market names and product names were generated by ChatGpt; that was of course our only use of that service.
The jupyter source files are where the dataset was created.

In order to import our data, you'll need to first create the relations using our sql file. Then you can import the data into each of the relations in the order our sql 
file creates the relations. So to import each of our relation csv into a relation, you'll need to right click on the empty created relation on the left side and choose
the Import/Export Data option. Then select the corresponding csv file in the database_files/csv_files folder of our project directory. The file name should make it obvious which csv
belongs to which relation. 

If the directions of importing the csv files into each relation is not clear, you can try using this resource: https://blog.n8n.io/import-csv-into-postgresql/.
You do not need to click on any buttons in the options window of the import screen since our csv files are already properly formatted and has no headers. Just select
the file and import.
